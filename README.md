This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Installs all packages.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### Follow-up questions and answers:

`1. How long did you spend on the test?`

I was making this test about 3-4 hours

`2. What would you add if you had more time?`

I would add:
1. Unit tests on Jest
2. More beautiful markup with loader and niceties to attract the customer
3. Redux to manage the store
4. Storybook to have reusable components
5. More advanced backend

`3. How would you improve the product APIs that you had to consume?`

I would put promotions info into the main product list. To avoid unnecessary API calls and optimise the performance.

`4. What did you find most difficult?`

Discount calculations

`5. How did you find the overall experience, any feedback for us?`

It's a very good test task. A lot of place to create and architect. Looking forward to take a glance at your project, looks very promising as for me.
